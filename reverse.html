        <span>S</span>hall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        <span>T</span>hou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
        <span>R</span>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        <span>A</span>nd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
        <span>S</span>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        <span>A</span>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
        <span>A</span>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        <span>B</span>y chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
        <span>B</span>ut thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        <span>N</span>or lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
        <span>N</span>or shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
        <span>W</span>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
        <span>S</span>o long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        <span>S</span>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
